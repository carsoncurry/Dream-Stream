# DreamStream

DreamStream is the perfect resource for users wanting to search for shows, movies, genres, actors and anything else involved with their favorite viewing materials and discover on which service providers they can be viewed. Using Auth0 authentication users can create profiles where they can store all of their monthly streaming subscriptions and keep a budget that allows them to maximize their viewing capabilities. 

## Getting Started

      Summary
      
     2. Profile Creation: Using Auth0 login, users can create their own profile that saves searches (function in progress) and monthly budgets (see below).
     
     3. Monthly Budgeting: Once logged in to DreamStream profile users can add whatever streaming service they are currently subscribed to (or remove dropped services) to view their monthly streaming budget and compare against standard cable subscription rates.
